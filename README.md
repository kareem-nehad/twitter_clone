## *Architecture*

*BLoC (Business Logic Component) is a design pattern and architectural concept used in software development, specifically in frameworks like Flutter. It helps separate the business logic of an application from its user interface, making the code more manageable and testable.*

*In BLoC, the application's logic and functionality are encapsulated in the Business Logic component. User interactions, external triggers, or other inputs are represented as Events that initiate changes in the application's state. The state represents the current condition of the application and is updated based on the events processed by the Business Logic*

*At its core, BLoC consists of three main components:*

1.  **Business Logic**: *This component represents the core logic and functionality of an application. It encapsulates the operations, computations, and transformations required to process data and perform tasks.*

2.  **Events**: *Events in BLoC represent user interactions, external triggers, or any other inputs that initiate changes in the application state. For example, a button press, network response, or a user input field update can be events.*

3.  **States**: *States represent the current state of the application, reflecting changes triggered by events. They can include information such as data loaded, an error occurred, or a loading state. Each state is immutable and represents a snapshot of the application at a specific point in time.*
